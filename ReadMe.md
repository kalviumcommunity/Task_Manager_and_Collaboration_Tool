Task_Manager_And_Collaboration_Tool

Project Idea: The proposed project aims to develop a Task Management and Collaboration Tool, a comprehensive platform for teams to manage projects efficiently, collaborate seamlessly, and enhance productivity. This tool will utilize a MySQL database to store project data, user information, tasks, and communication logs. It will feature a web-based interface built using React for the frontend and a Node.js backend for data processing.
